title: Python wrapping using SWIG and NumPy
published: true
---

I recently learned how to use SWIG to wrap C++ code with Python, along with
NumPy. Here are some of the existing resources for learning how to do this:

1. SWIG [documentation][swig]
2. NumPy SWIG interface file [documentation][numpyswig]
3. [Using CMake to build libraries generated by SWIG][cmakeswig]

# The given C++ library

We assume that we already have a C++ library that we want to wrap. That is, we have the header files for the library, shared libraries

# Setting up a SWIG target in CMake

# Creating an interface file

# Using typemaps

# Using NumPy arrays for input and output

{% highlight python %}
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
{% endhighlight %}
