                    game</h3>

                <p>
                A physics-based 2-D side-scroller game, written in
                C++, using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
                (<a href="http://sfml-dev.org">SFML</a>) and the <a
                    href="http://box2d.org">Box2D</a> physics engine. Zorbit
                must navigate a circular world to defeat the evil Globulons.

            <div class="desc"><h3>Introductory engineering
                    course</h3>

                <p>
                I taught a 1-trimester course in engineering at the Phillips
                Andover Academy boarding school in Andover, MA. We covered
                MATLAB programming, statics, finite element analysis of
                trusses, dynamics, robotics, and system dynamics, and the
                course finished with a design project.

            <div class="desc"><h3>Neutronics model</h3>

                <p>
                In a nuclear power reactor, millions of free neutrons are flying
                around, at speeds ranging from 100 to 100,000 miles per hour.
                 To design a nuclear reactor, engineers
                must know how these neutrons move about. We employ a
                "collision probability" method that reduces the complexity of
                this modeling task with a minimal reduction in accuracy.

                This was an MS thesis project at UT Austin under <a
                    href="http://www.me.utexas.edu/directory/faculty/deinert/mark">Dr.
                    Deinert</a>.

            <div class="desc"><h3>Estimating a human's inertia properties</h3>

                <p>Want to perform experiments to study the dynamics of
                gymnastics, or how a human controls a bicycle? You'll need the
                inertia properties of your human subject. In 2011 I worked in
                the <a href="http://biosport.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis Biosport
                    Lab</a>, which studies bicycle
                dynamics. They were validating their model via experiments, and
                I implemented a method for computing their human subjects'
                inertia properties. See <a
                    href="http://pythonhosted.org/yeadon/">website</a>, <a

            <div class="desc"><h3>Fuel cladding hybridization</h3>

                <p>
                In nuclear reactors, uranium fuel is contained within
                zirconium fuel rods. Over time, these rods become brittle.

                As part of the <a
                    href="http://www.mne.psu.edu/twfp">Toshiba-Westinghouse
                    Fellowship Program</a> at Penn State University, I designed
                an experimental procedure that mimics this embrittling. Such
                work enables engineers to design better fuel rods. <a
                    href="/documents/dembia_twfp_poster.pdf">Here</a>
                is a poster on this work that I presented at the 2010 American
                Nuclear Society meeting.

                <p>
                A 4-minute flash animation I created for the
                2011 class of the Sibley School of
                Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell
                University. The video shows the journey of a
                student through his/her required classes, and each
                class comes to life and poses a challenge to the
                student. See related videos, created for the same
                project, at <a

                    Argondizza</a> based off course notes for the

                    href="http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu">Dr.
                    Ruina</a>. Topics include fundamentals about

                energy usage, the SLIP (inverted pendulum) model of locomotion,
                and passive control. Contact any of us for more

                <p>
                The beginnings of a three dimensional rigid body
                dynamics engine, based on the articulated body
                algorithm formulated by Dr. Featherstone.  It is
                mostly an object-oriented port to C++ (using the
                GNU Scientific Library) of MATLAB code that Dr.
                Featherstone has on his website, with my own simple
                path planning and control.

                    droplet combustion experiments</h3>

                <p>
                By understanding more about the combustion of hydrocarbons, we
                can design more efficient jet engines. One way to
                learn about hydrocarbons is to film the burning of a
                small droplet of fuel in a zero-gravity
                environment. To obtain data from the film,
                grad students manually process each frame of the film. I wrote
                an image analysis routine to automate this data processing.

                <p>
                Every two years, the Department of Energy selects
                20 universities to design and build an 800 square
                foot solar house, and has them bring the houses to the
                National Mall in D.C. (in 2013, they'll be in
                California) to show to the public. For <a

                performed most of the electrical wiring of the
                house, and some of the installation of the house's
